## Usage

The Real-Time Fact Check Application is a web-based tool designed to verify the accuracy of information in news articles and other textual content. Utilizing a method called Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator (SAFE), the application automates the extraction and analysis of smaller constituent facts in the given input fact which are known as atomic facts.
Key features include:
- URL-Based Text Extraction: Extracts and cleans main content from news articles, filtering out advertisements, sponsorships, and irrelevant sections.
- Text Input Processing: Allows direct text input for fact-checking.
- Bulk URL Processing: Supports batch processing of multiple URLs from a .txt file.
- Detailed Fact Analysis: Provides comprehensive fact-checking results, including supported facts and related search results.
- User-Friendly Interface: Offers an intuitive interface with detailed statistics and analysis results.
